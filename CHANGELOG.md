❗ Big Step Forward

This update may not be packed with tons of new features, but it’s a major milestone for the addon. **Keystone Percentage Helper** now integrates with **Mythic Dungeon Tools**, unlocking awesome new possibilities — like showing a mob’s percentage right next to its nameplate.

The highly anticipated **Mob Indicator** was planned for this patch, but due to Blizzard’s API restrictions, a reliable system couldn’t be implemented. I’ll keep looking for ways to bring it to life in the future.

And this is only the beginning — more tools and features will be added to shape the addon into the Swiss Army knife I envision.
